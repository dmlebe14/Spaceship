Code snippets from my Bachelor thesis done on MATLAB.

The task was to calculate the parameters for the optimal control of a spacecraft's landing on the Moon using evolutionary optimisation algorithms.
A system of five differential equations was given, utilising which the whole calculation approach was based.
After that it was necessary to calculate the parameters in order to find the optimal control. Those parameters were calculated using several evolutionary algorithms and using MATLAB programming language.
