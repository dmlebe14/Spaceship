# The Spaceship
Code snippets from my project from my Bachelor studies done on MATLAB.

The task was to calculate the parameters for the optimal control of a spacecraft's landing on the Moon using evolutionary optimisation algorithms.
A system of five differential equations was given, utilising which the whole calculation approach was based.
After that it was necessary to calculate the parameters (u1 and u2) in order to find the optimal control. Those parameters were calculated using "Jaya" and "Grey Wolf" evolutionary algorithms on MATLAB programming language.
